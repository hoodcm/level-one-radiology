## Clinical Presentation

A 67-year-old male presents with 2 days of worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and absence of bowel movements. No recent surgeries. Exam shows a distended, tympanitic abdomen with diffuse tenderness.

## Imaging Findings

CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast demonstrates:

- Dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels
- A discrete transition point in the mid-jejunum
- Collapsed distal small bowel and colon
- No evidence of bowel wall thickening, pneumatosis, or free air

These findings are consistent with a **mechanical small bowel obstruction** without signs of ischemia or perforation.

## Diagnosis

**Mechanical small bowel obstruction** due to adhesions, without signs of strangulation.

## Teaching Points

- Look for a **clear transition point** between dilated and decompressed bowel.
- Evaluate for secondary signs of ischemia (wall thickening, lack of enhancement).
- Free air or mesenteric stranding should raise concern for perforation or ischemia.
