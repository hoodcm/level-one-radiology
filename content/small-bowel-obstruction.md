## Clinical Presentation

A 67-year-old male presents with 2 days of worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and absence of bowel movements. No recent surgeries. Exam shows a distended, tympanitic abdomen with diffuse tenderness.

The patient reports that the abdominal discomfort began as intermittent cramping but has progressively intensified, now associated with persistent bloating and repeated episodes of non-bilious vomiting. He denies fever, chills, or recent travel, and notes a prior history of hypertension and mild chronic kidney disease. There is no history of abdominal malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, or prior radiation.

On further examination, vital signs are stable, but the patient appears uncomfortable and is intermittently writhing on the stretcher. The abdominal exam reveals mild guarding without rebound or peritoneal signs. Bowel sounds are high-pitched and frequent. Rectal exam is unremarkable, and there is no evidence of hernias. Laboratory studies show mild leukocytosis, but lactate is within normal limits.

## Imaging Findings

CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast demonstrates:

- Dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels
- A discrete transition point in the mid-jejunum
- Collapsed distal small bowel and colon
- No evidence of bowel wall thickening, pneumatosis, or free air

These findings are consistent with a **mechanical small bowel obstruction** without signs of ischemia or perforation.

The imaging was performed with adequate oral and intravenous contrast, ensuring optimal visualization of the bowel lumen and wall. Evaluation of the transition point is critical, as it helps differentiate between mechanical and functional causes of obstruction. In this case, the transition point in the mid-jejunum, with proximal dilation and distal decompression, strongly suggests a focal mechanical etiology.

Differential considerations on CT include closed-loop obstruction, intussusception, and neoplastic processes, but the absence of bowel wall thickening, mesenteric swirling, or mass lesion makes these less likely. The radiologist also carefully assessed for subtle signs of ischemia, such as diminished wall enhancement or mesenteric edema, which were not present. There is no evidence of ascites or extraluminal gas, further supporting the absence of perforation or advanced ischemic change.

## Diagnosis

**Mechanical small bowel obstruction** due to adhesions, without signs of strangulation.

The diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction is based on the clinical presentation and corroborated by characteristic imaging findings, including a transition point and decompressed distal bowel. In patients without a history of prior abdominal surgery, adhesions remain a common cause, though hernia and neoplasm must also be considered. The absence of imaging findings suggestive of ischemia or perforation supports an initial trial of conservative management, including bowel rest, nasogastric decompression, and close monitoring for clinical deterioration.

Clinical decision-making involves serial abdominal exams and laboratory monitoring for evolving signs of ischemia, such as increasing pain out of proportion, peritonitis, or rising lactate. Surgical consultation is recommended, and operative intervention is reserved for patients who fail conservative therapy or develop complications such as strangulation or perforation. Early recognition and appropriate management are essential to minimize morbidity and mortality in these patients.

## Teaching Points

- Identification of a **clear transition point** between dilated and decompressed bowel is a hallmark of mechanical small bowel obstruction. Recognizing this feature helps distinguish true obstruction from ileus or other functional disorders and guides the search for an underlying cause at the transition site.

- It is essential to evaluate for secondary signs of ischemia, such as bowel wall thickening, diminished or absent wall enhancement, and mesenteric edema. These findings may indicate compromised blood flow and impending bowel infarction, necessitating urgent surgical intervention to prevent irreversible injury.

- The presence of free intraperitoneal air or pronounced mesenteric stranding should immediately raise concern for bowel perforation or advanced ischemia. These findings are associated with a higher risk of morbidity and require prompt surgical evaluation, as delayed management can lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
