keyPoints:
  - "The guidelines mandate site-specific validation before deployment — no more vendor benchmarks as sufficient evidence"
  - "Continuous monitoring requirements create new operational burdens that fall disproportionately on academic sites"
  - "Emergency radiology is uniquely affected: high volume, time pressure, and heterogeneous patient populations challenge AI performance assumptions"

## The Guidelines in Context

The ACR's 2025 update to its AI deployment framework arrives at an inflection point. Over 300 FDA-cleared AI products exist for radiology, yet adoption remains uneven, validation practices vary wildly, and the gap between vendor claims and real-world performance is an open secret.

These guidelines attempt to bring order to the chaos.

## What Changed

### Site-Specific Validation Is Now Expected

The most consequential change: the ACR now explicitly states that vendor-provided performance data is insufficient for deployment decisions. Each site must validate AI tools against its own patient population, workflow, and imaging protocols.

For emergency radiology departments running 24/7 with heterogeneous scanners and protocols, this is both welcome and burdensome. Welcome because emergency populations are underrepresented in most training datasets. Burdensome because validation infrastructure requires resources that many departments lack.

### Continuous Performance Monitoring

Post-deployment monitoring is no longer a suggestion — it is a defined expectation. The guidelines outline minimum requirements for tracking sensitivity, specificity, and false positive rates over time.

The unspoken challenge: who does this work? In most departments, the answer is unclear.

### Radiologist Override Documentation

The guidelines introduce documentation requirements when radiologists override AI recommendations. The stated purpose is quality improvement, but the medicolegal implications are obvious and unaddressed.

## What's Missing

The guidelines are notably silent on several critical questions for emergency radiology:

**Workflow integration.** How should AI results be presented during overnight single-coverage? A notification that adds 10 seconds per study has a different impact at 3 AM than at 10 AM.

**Liability.** If a validated AI tool misses a finding, and the radiologist relies on the AI's negative result, who bears responsibility? The guidelines punt on this.

**Cost.** Per-study AI licensing fees are nontrivial at emergency radiology volumes. The guidelines address clinical validity but not economic sustainability.

## The Bottom Line

These guidelines are a step forward in formalizing what responsible AI deployment looks like. But they create new obligations without addressing the resource constraints that make compliance difficult. Emergency radiology departments should begin planning validation infrastructure now — the expectation is set, even if the timeline is not.
