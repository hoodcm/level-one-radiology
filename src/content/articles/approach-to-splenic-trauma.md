  - "Active extravasation on CT does not always mandate surgery — contained vs. free extravasation matters"

## Why This Matters

Splenic injury is the most common solid organ injury in blunt abdominal trauma. The decision between operative and nonoperative management hinges on imaging findings, yet the nuances of CT interpretation are often underappreciated.

## The Systematic Approach

### Step 1: Identify the Injury

Begin with the basics. Look for perisplenic fluid, parenchymal disruption, and subcapsular collections. The spleen's homogeneous enhancement on portal venous phase makes lacerations and hematomas relatively conspicuous.

### Step 2: Grade the Injury

The AAST Organ Injury Scale provides a common language, but remember: the scale was designed for operative findings, not CT. Imaging-based grading correlates imperfectly with surgical grade.

### Step 3: Look for Vascular Injury

This is where the critical decisions are made. Active extravasation, pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula all represent vascular injuries — but they carry different implications.

**Active extravasation** appears as a focus of contrast that increases in attenuation from arterial to portal venous phase. The key distinction: is it contained within the splenic parenchyma, or is it free in the peritoneal cavity?

### Step 4: Assess for Associated Injuries

Splenic injury rarely occurs in isolation. Evaluate the left hemidiaphragm, left kidney, pancreatic tail, and left lower ribs.

## Decision Framework

The management algorithm integrates hemodynamic status, injury grade, and vascular findings. No single imaging feature dictates management — it is the combination that matters.

## Key Takeaway

A systematic approach prevents the two most common errors: overcalling minor injuries that lead to unnecessary intervention, and undercalling vascular injuries that require angiographic or operative management.
