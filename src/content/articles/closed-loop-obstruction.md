## The Clinical Problem

Closed-loop obstruction accounts for a disproportionate share of bowel obstruction morbidity. Unlike simple mechanical obstruction, a closed loop has no proximal decompression pathway — the trapped segment distends rapidly, venous outflow is compromised first, and ischemia follows.

The radiologist's job: identify the closed loop before ischemia becomes irreversible.

## Anatomy of a Closed Loop

A closed loop requires two points of obstruction along a single bowel segment. The most common mechanism is adhesive band wrapping around a loop, creating both proximal and distal transition points. Internal hernias and volvulus produce the same configuration.

## The CT Signs

### Definitive Signs

**Converging mesenteric vessels (the "beak" or "whirl" sign):** Follow the mesenteric vessels to the transition point. In a closed loop, vessels from separate mesenteric leaves converge toward a single point — the site of torsion or compression.

**C-sign or U-sign:** The closed loop itself forms a C or U shape, with the two limbs converging at the obstruction point. This is best appreciated on coronal reformats.

### Signs of Ischemia

**Decreased wall enhancement:** Compare the enhancement of the closed-loop segment to adjacent normal bowel on portal venous phase. Reduced or absent enhancement is the most specific CT finding for nonviable bowel.

**Mesenteric haziness:** Edema and hemorrhage in the mesentery of the affected loop indicate venous congestion progressing toward ischemia.

**High-density intraluminal contents:** Hemorrhagic fluid within the closed loop (measuring >20 HU) suggests mucosal ischemia.

## The Interpretation Framework

Not every closed-loop obstruction requires emergency surgery. The key is distinguishing strangulation (compromised blood supply) from simple closed-loop obstruction (mechanical only). Enhancement is your most reliable tool.

## Key Takeaway

Identify the two transition points, trace the closed loop between them, and assess for ischemia by evaluating wall enhancement. When in doubt, communicate urgency — the surgical team needs to know this is not a simple SBO.
