## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- Layout grid primitive (`src/components/layout/`): `<Container>` (page shell — width cap + centering + page margin; `width` prop maps to `--grid-max-width`/`--media-column`/`--reading-column`), `<Grid>` (responsive column track with constant `--grid-gutter` column gap + separate overridable `rowGap`), `<Col span>` (spans the active tier's columns; scalar or per-tier `{base,md,lg}`, mobile-first full-width default). Replaces hand-rolled `grid-template-columns` and re-declared container shells
- Design-system reasoning layer (`docs/principles/`): `README.md` (application order — tokens → principles → polish, tokens win on conflict), plus `layout-`, `spacing-`, `typography-principles.md` and `accessibility.md`, adapted from the typeui `fundamentals/` model and wired to Level One's own tokens/methodology. Linked from CLAUDE.md
- CLAUDE.md "Key Design Decisions" rule forbidding hand-rolled `grid-template-columns`/container shells; layout must go through the primitive
- Text-stroke faux-bold for single-weight Michroma (`--wordmark-stroke-*` tokens) — synthesizes heavier weights on a one-weight display face; mobile hero wordmark tuned for size/stroke/tracking/line-height and left-edge alignment

### Changed
- Grid tokens promoted to three first-class, breakpoint-aware roles: `--grid-margin` (page edge → content, 32→40→56), `--grid-gutter` (between columns, constant 16px; renamed from `--grid-gap`), `--grid-columns` (6→12→18 at mobile/≥600px/≥960px; was 4→12). The tiers nest: 1 mobile col = 2 tablet = 3 desktop
- Migrated the homepage hero/featured-section/header shells and the footer onto `<Container>`/`<Grid>`/`<Col>`; the four duplicated container shells and two hand-rolled grids removed. Featured grid is now an 11/7 desktop split (was 7fr/5fr); footer is 3/3/6 tablet → 5/5/8 desktop (was 1fr/1fr/1.5fr). Column gaps are now the systematic 16px gutter (featured grid was 48px, footer 32px); footer keeps its 48px stacked-mobile rhythm via `<Grid rowGap>`
- Retired the `--space-outer` token; all consumers (mobile-menu, FeatureBand) now reference `--grid-margin`
- Typography swapped to OFL faces — Newsreader (display, was Utopia Std), DM Sans (body, was Lab Grotesque), Michroma (UI/brand, was Eurostile), Chivo Mono (mono, was IBM Plex Mono); originals retained as CSS fallbacks. **Gotcha:** loaded from the Google Fonts CDN, not self-hosted like the rest — self-hosting still pending

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- Above-the-fold font preloads (`Layout.astro`): Eurostile ext regular/bold, Utopia regular, Lab Grotesque regular — eliminates the hero font-swap reflow flash on load

### Changed
- Converted the full self-hosted font library (47 faces) from `.otf`/`.ttf` to woff2 (~50% smaller); every `@font-face` repointed, originals moved out of the repo
- Homepage hero rebuilt mobile-first: dropped the kicker line and inline newsletter, enlarged the two-line wordmark (`--fz-wordmark-hero` → 2.5rem, 0.92 leading), replaced the tagline with a smaller serif statement (`--fz-hero-subtitle`)
- Hero wordmark animates in via a staggered baseline mask reveal (lines rise from clip windows); held static under `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Feature band reworked into a scroll-linked X-ray detector panel — blank at rest, peeks ~30svh on load, widens contained→full-bleed on scroll (`--fb-progress`), boots its HUD once scrolled past the peek, detector fades out (card stays) ~1.5s after returning to top
- Feature-band HUD is a fixed-size square panel (sized to the contained card width via `--fb-card-min-h`) that does not scale as the card widens; scanline recolored cyan → yellow
- Featured cards render uniformly (lead-card special formatting removed, gaps unified to `--gap-md`); "Featured" label set in Eurostile W1G extended, larger
- All pill text vertically centered (`line-height: 1` on tags + the Subscribe button) — uppercase Eurostile was sitting high in the boxes
- Removed semicolons from the three seed articles' body copy, per the site's no-semicolon copy rule

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- Extended article prose elements (`prose.css`): data tables, callouts (note / caution / critical), reference/data card, definition lists, run-in lead-ins, opt-in lead paragraph, and inline kbd + highlight. Apparatus reads sans, narrative stays serif (Anthropic voice split); authored in Markdown via raw HTML and demonstrated in the closed-loop article
- Full-bleed feature band (`FeatureBand.astro`): the homepage's one signature scroll moment — a contained card that expands edge-to-edge as it scrolls into view (and contracts on exit), mirroring Anthropic's full-bleed globe. Bespoke HUD "scanner/aperture" SVG visual (grid, CT-bore rings, cyan crosshair + scanline, registration brackets) using design tokens; inset serif statement + Subscribe CTA. Progressive enhancement — readable without JS, held contained under `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Scroll-reveal engine (`src/styles/base/motion.css` + global IntersectionObserver in `Layout.astro`): toggles a state class on entry/exit for `[data-reveal]` (fade/translate utility) and `[data-expand]` (the feature band), gated behind `prefers-reduced-motion`. Reserved for specific feature moments (Anthropic-style), not blanket-applied to body content
- Desktop wordmark → icon-mark collapse on scroll: past a 32px scroll threshold (`is-scrolled`, rAF-throttled) the wordmark's JS-measured width animates to 0, contracting horizontally into the compact icon mark
- Mobile hero brand wordmark (`hero__wordmark`): shows the "Level One Radiology" lockup on mobile, where the header carries only the icon mark; hidden ≥48em. New `--fz-wordmark-hero` token
- Article page template (`src/pages/articles/[slug].astro`) — full editorial reading view; all homepage cards now link through
- `prose.css` long-form reading system: type metrics mirror Anthropic's live article (body 17px, sans headings, 640px reading column, exact paragraph/heading vertical rhythm), expressed in Level One's fonts (Utopia serif body, Lab Grotesque sans titles/headings) and dark palette
- Self-hosted favicon (`public/favicon.svg`, the Level One mark) — also the mobile header logo
- Full-screen mobile nav overlay (icon + hamburger → ✕, Anthropic-style rows, bottom CTA)
- Semantic tokens: nested content widths (`--reading-column`/`--media-column`), radius scale (`--radius-xs/sm/md/lg`), card-padding, section-spacer, gap, reading line-height, inline-link metrics — values flip at shared breakpoints
- Live-motion GIFs (11) and mobile-viewport screenshots (6) across the Scrib3, Component Gallery, and Anthropic design references — embedded inline beside each description
- Motion & interaction documentation for the three design references — autonomous, scroll, hover, click, and load animations captured live (Anthropic §7 new; Scrib3 + Component Gallery Motion sections expanded)
- Responsive / horizontal-span documentation across the three design references — per-breakpoint behavior, fluid type, and what restructures at each width

### Changed
- Reduced peak text luminance to cut halation ("bloom") of bright text on the near-black ground: `--color-text-ivory` #FAF6EE → #EFEAE0, `--color-text-primary` #F4F0E9 → #E5E1DB. Contrast stays ~15:1 (well above AAA); warm bias preserved
- Article body leading tightened for a denser serif column: `--lh-reading` 1.45 → 1.38
- Article editorial pass: removed the `###` subheader level and all bold run-ins across the three articles, folding them into flowing prose. Leaves each article with `##` section headers + body only (plus callout/table/reference-card apparatus), cutting the font-size/weight variety that read as chaotic
- Removed em dashes from all site copy (article content, hero, feature band, page titles, aria-labels), replaced with colon / comma / semicolon per context
- Homepage featured articles now read as raised cards on a distinct ground: the section moved to `bg-primary` and cards to `bg-raised` (both were `bg-secondary`, so cards did not separate); hover lifts to `bg-active`
- Homepage card titles reduced: standard cards 24 → 20px (new `--fz-card-title` token), lead card 28/32 → 24px, so titles read as card labels rather than dominating the card
- Hero typography unified to three voices (was four): the "No spam" privacy line moved off IBM Plex Mono onto the body voice (Lab Grotesque), so all hero reading text shares one family. Hero now reads Utopia (headline) · Lab Grotesque (value-prop, email field, privacy) · Eurostile (kicker, Subscribe, mobile wordmark); mono is reserved for article metadata
- Eurostile import corrected: the extended-width branding face is now declared under its true family name **"Eurostile Next W1G"** (was the generic "Eurostile Extended"), sourced from the W1G Extended OTFs (UltraLight→Bold + italics); `--ff-ui-ext` points at it. Old `eurostile-ext-*.otf` duplicates removed
- Mobile nav overlay opens via a clip-path wipe (0.25s) instead of a plain fade; hamburger→✕ is a staggered two-step morph (slide-to-center, then rotate, 0.15s). Both gated behind `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Header: icon + hamburger on mobile (<768px), wordmark + inline nav on desktop (≥768px); bar height grows 48→56px
- Article type roles parallel Anthropic — sans title + sans deck + serif body
- Warm-white text ramp de-yellowed (`--color-text-ivory` `#F5E6C2` → `#FAF6EE`, etc.); consistent subtle warm bias. Dark surfaces unchanged — site stays dark-first
- Mobile page gutter 24 → 32px (Anthropic-style); homepage card titles → sans; radii / card padding / section spacing now token-driven
- Refreshed the three design-reference docs against live site CSS — corrected Scrib3 to its two-state 800px grid, refreshed token/grid systems, updated the Component Gallery example count, noted Anthropic's now-fluid marketing margin

### Fixed
- Homepage cards rendered with only 2px content padding: `.hud-frame { padding: 2px }` (the decorative corner-bracket utility) overrode `.article-card`'s padding by later source order at equal specificity, so the padding token never applied. Removed padding from `.hud-frame`; cards now use their own `--card-padding-md` (24/32) / `--card-padding-lg`
- Mobile menu broke when opened while scrolled: the `overflow:hidden` scroll-lock was killing the sticky header (and jumping scroll). Replaced with a full-viewport overlay, no lock
- Removed the `/favicon.ico` 404 (SVG favicon only)
- Broken relative image paths in `scrib3.DESIGN.md` (asset-folder prefix → bare filenames, since the doc lives inside its asset folder)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- Homepage with 4 sections: sticky nav, hero with newsletter CTA, featured articles grid, footer
- Header component (48px sticky nav, ARTICLES / ABOUT / SUBSCRIBE)
