## Brand Identity

### What Level One Is

A one-person trade publication with educational depthâ€”a platform that combines the timeliness of Radiology Business with the educational rigor of RadioGraphics, executed with design sophistication and a singular authorial voice.

### What Level One Is Not

- An online CV
- A wiki
- A case repository
- A forum
- A corporate website

### Core Principle

This is owned infrastructure. Unlike journal publications, institutional affiliations, or social media presence, Level One Radiology is completely independentâ€”a platform where content, design, and editorial decisions are entirely self-determined.

### Primary Function

Build national reputation and thought leadership in emergency radiology through substantive, well-designed content that demonstrates clinical expertise, educational skill, and intellectual depth.

---

## Strategic Goals

*In priority order:*

1. **National reputation as thought leader** â€” Become a recognizable voice in emergency radiology, invited to speak, write editorials, and shape discourse

2. **Educational impact** â€” Create content that concretely helps readers' understanding and practice

3. **Academic advancement within Harvard/Partners** â€” Build a scholarly portfolio that supports promotion and leadership positions

4. **Future revenue potential** â€” Establish a platform that could eventually support courses, consulting, or subscriptions (secondary, not immediate)

---

## Positioning

Emergency radiology is the generalist fieldâ€”coverage extends to radiology-wide content when relevant.

The platform occupies a unique position: **authored depth with clinical utility and design sophistication**. No existing publication combines these elements.

---

## Audience

### Primary

Radiologists (practicing and trainees), with extension to radiology-adjacent clinicians (emergency physicians, surgeons) interested in imaging.

### Sub-Audiences

Consider these in content design:

| Segment | Needs |
|---------|-------|
| **Residents/trainees** | Educational content, approach frameworks, case-based learning |
| **Practicing radiologists** | Efficiency, clinical pearls, staying current; time-constrained |
| **Radiology-adjacent clinicians** | Slightly more foundational context |
| **Informatics/AI-interested readers** | Perspective on field trends, technology, policy |

### Default Writing Level

Practicing radiologist. Trainees learn from this; non-radiologists self-filter.

## Keystone Metrics

*Based on Fictive Kin principle: One keystone metric, maximum two. Everything else is diagnostic. See [DESIGN-METHODOLOGY.md](DESIGN-METHODOLOGY.md).*

### Primary Keystone: Email Subscribers

This is the single most important metric. Every design decision should be evaluated against: **"Does this help or hurt subscriber conversion?"**

Email subscribers represent:
- Owned audience independent of algorithm changes
- Direct channel for future content, announcements, offerings
- Compounding asset that grows with each piece published

### Secondary Metric: Returning Visitors

Signals that content is valuable enough to come back for. Indicates building loyalty and habit.

### Diagnostic Metrics (not keystones)

- Traffic by source (Google vs. LinkedIn vs. direct)
- Top articles by views
- Conversion rate (visitors â†’ subscribers)
- Time on site
- Social shares

**Interpretation:**
- High traffic with low conversion = problem with CTA or value proposition
- High time-on-site with low conversion = people like content but aren't being asked to subscribe effectively

---

## Content Architecture

### Content Philosophy

Articles are the primary content form. Cases support articles as embedded evidence/examples, not as standalone primary content. Cases may be aggregated into a gallery view but their primary purpose is to enrich articles.

Content is created by collating literature, cases, lecture transcripts, and textbook material, combined with original analysis and perspective. Promotion happens via LinkedIn to drive traffic to the owned platform.

### Content Types (Job Map)

*Based on Fictive Kin's page type framework. See [DESIGN-METHODOLOGY.md](DESIGN-METHODOLOGY.md).*

#### Collectors (SEO workhorses, long-term value)

- Educational articles ("Approach to Splenic Trauma on CT")
- Case analyses (deep dives on specific cases with teaching points)
- Reference entries (defined terms, findings, canonical explanations)

Written with search intent in mind. What would a resident type into Google at 2am? That's the headline.

**Job:** Build SEO gravity over time, pull visitors from search, route to subscription.

**Metric:** % who subscribe or click to another article after reading.

**SEO requirements:**
- Visible Table of Contents for articles over 1500 words
- Meta description (150-160 characters) for every article
- Consider visible "Key Points" block at top
- Descriptive URLs (`/articles/approach-to-splenic-trauma`)
- Internal linking between related articles

#### Attractors (timely, shareable, shorter shelf life)

- Commentary on new guidelines, papers, or policies
- Field analysis ("What the 2025 ACR AI Guidelines Mean for Emergency Radiology")
- Trend pieces ("Why Radiologists Should Pay Attention to [X]")

These are LinkedIn fuel. They drive traffic spikes. The article itself doesn't need to be evergreen because its job is attraction, not collection.

**Job:** Generate social sharing, drive traffic spikes, convert percentage to subscribers.

**Requirements:**
- Strong Open Graph metadata (compelling preview when shared)
- Speed to publish (respond to news within days, not weeks)
- Shareable structure (quotable insights, clear takeaways)

#### Converters

- Newsletter signup (embedded in every article + standalone landing page)
- About page (soft conversionâ€”builds trust, ends with CTA)

**Job:** Turn visitors into subscribers.

#### Informers

- Contact page
- Privacy policy
- 404 page (small opportunity for personality)

**Job:** Exist. Keep minimal.

### Page Types & Jobs

*Each page has one job and is measured on whether visitors do the target action.*

| Page | One Job | Success Metric |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Article | Get reader to subscribe (or read another article) | % who subscribe or click to related content |
| Case Gallery | Get reader into a case â†’ article â†’ subscribe | % who click into a case |
| About | Build trust, then subscribe | % who subscribe after visiting |
| Subscribe (landing) | Subscribe | Conversion rate |
| Homepage | Route to content that leads to subscription | % who click to an article |

**Design implications:**
- **Article pages:** No distracting navigation or sidebars. Reader's job is read, then subscribe.
- **Case gallery:** Enticing thumbnails, clear labels, easy filtering. Job is getting someone into a case.
- **About page:** Ends with CTA. "If this resonates, subscribe."
- **Homepage:** Not a magazine cover with twenty entry points. Feature 3-5 pieces, clear value proposition, newsletter CTA.

## Content Cadence

### Commitment

Establish sustainable rhythm before launch. One article per month minimum = 12 per year, a substantial body of work.

### Principle

Regularity matters more than volume. A site that looks the same for six months signals abandonment.

### Tactics

- Batch content creation during writing sessions
- Maintain a pipeline of drafts at various stages
- Schedule quarterly review of content performance

---

## Conversion Flow

*Based on Fictive Kin: Minimize steps, don't get greedy, remove distractions.*

### The Flow

1. Visitor lands on article (from LinkedIn, Google, referral)
2. Reads
3. Encounters newsletter CTA (mid-article or end)
4. Subscribes
5. Receives future content via email
6. Returns to site for full articles
7. Becomes regular reader and advocate

### Newsletter Signup Specifications

**Steps (user actions):**
1. See CTA
2. Enter email
3. Click Subscribe
4. See confirmation

That's it. Three actions, one outcome.

**Do not:**
- Ask for name
- Ask for preferences/interests
- Require email confirmation before adding (know your jurisdiction on double opt-in)
- Redirect to separate page for form
- Show popup that interrupts reading

**CTA design:**
- Solid button, Signal Red background
- Label: "Subscribe" not "Submit"
- Value proposition visible: "Weekly insights on emergency radiology"
- Privacy reassurance: "No spam. Unsubscribe anytime." (small text, muted)

**Post-conversion:**
- Show confirmation inline (not separate page)
- Message: "You're in. Check your inbox for a welcome email."
- Optionally offer to explore more content
- Do NOT immediately ask for more information

## Navigation Structure

*Based on Fictive Kin: Minimal primary nav, comprehensive footer. Links earn their spot.*

### Primary Navigation (4 items maximum)

| Item | Label | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Content Index | `ARTICLES` | Main content listing |
| Case Gallery | `CASES` | Defer to footer until 10+ cases |
| About | `ABOUT` | Credibility and context |
| Subscribe CTA | `SUBSCRIBE` | Button-styled, visually distinct |

**Behavior:**
- Sticky on scroll
- Logo/wordmark links to homepage
- Mobile: Hamburger acceptable, but Subscribe CTA visible even when menu collapsed

### Footer (comprehensive)

Include:
- Full section links (Articles, Cases, About, Subscribe)
- Contact, Privacy Policy
- Social links (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, ORCID)
- RSS feed link (essential for academic audience)
- Brief tagline or mission statement
- Newsletter signup (last-chance conversion)
- Personality touch (registration marks, crafted feel, not boilerplate)

---

## Future Expansion

This document will grow to include:

- **Brand Voice & Tone** â€” How Level One sounds
- **Editorial Standards** â€” Writing guidelines, style decisions
- **Visual Brand Guidelines** â€” Logo usage, brand applications

These additions will complement the design system documents with the verbal and editorial dimensions of brand identity.
